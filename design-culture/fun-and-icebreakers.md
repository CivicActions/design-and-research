# Fun and Icebreakers

Having fun is an important part of building team camaraderie and balancing out the stress or pressure of the day-to-day. As a fully remote design team, it is important to find the right mix of fun and delight to help people context switch into a more creative space or find their presence in a new meeting. Here, we have aggregated some games, activities, and ice breakers that have worked well for our fully remote team.

- [Would You Rather: Design Edition Icebreaker](#would-you-rather-design-edition)
- [Prompt Party](#prompt-party)


## Gartic Phone

[Gartic Phone](https://garticphone.com/) is a free game that is a good mix of humor and creativity, especially when played with teams with big imaginations. Gartic Phone is a multiplayer drawing and guessing game where players alternate between writing a phrase and drawing what they think the previous player meant. As the round progresses, the original idea often becomes hilariously distorted, highlighting how meaning changes as it passes from person to person. It is easy to set up, allows for multiple players, and you can adjust the settings to fit a certain timebox as needed. 

## Would You Rather: Design Edition

We created this game as a fun icebreaker to position different design hot takes for people to think through which one they would choose over the other. 

### How We Facilitated This

We did this with a slide deck, with each Would You Rather question on an individual slide, and then we popcorned who would answer amongst meeting participants. Another way this could be run is by creating a Figjam or Mural, putting the questions there, and having people dot vote with their names what they would rather do.

### Would You Rather Prompts

Use these prompts to create your own version of this icebreaker!

- Only use Comic Sans or Papyrus forever?
- Have Figma be replaced by an Etch A Sketch or conduct research with a Magic 8-Ball?
- Only be able to use drop shadows aggressively or never be allowed to use whitespace again?
- Redesign Clippy for Gen Z or MySpace for government services?
- Every button you design says “YOLO” or every alert message begin with “Hear ye, hear ye”?
- Conduct user research in an escape room or a bounce house?
- All your user personas be actual celebrities or fictional characters from ‘90s cartoons?
- Receive design feedback from a fortune cookie or a toddler with a sticker chart?
- Have to narrate your entire design process out loud as you work or work in complete silence for a week?
- All your UX deliverables be printed on scrolls or etched into stone tablets?
- Work in a Figma file with 15 designers editing live or present a wireframe to a panel of animated Disney villains?
- Every design handoff require a choreographed dance or a dramatic reading?
- Give a UX talk while riding a unicycle or while your slides are controlled by someone else at random?

## Prompt Party

Prompt party is a great exercise for people to practice working with generative AI and prompt writing. Depending on your timebox, you can do one round or multiple rounds.

### How We Facilitated This
Create a Mural or a Figjam where everyone can have a section to paste their images once they are generated. In the Mural, include instructions and tips on how to generate an image. Also direct your teams to paste in their prompts alongside their images. These were the tips we shared:

1. Be Specific, Not Vague
Bad: "A garden"
Better: "A lush rooftop garden in Tokyo at sunset with string lights and koi ponds"
2. Include Visual Details
Mention things like:
Setting: (forest, city, underwater)
Objects/Subjects: (a cat, a robot, a treehouse)
Style: (watercolor, pixel art, photorealistic, line drawing)
Mood or Tone: (calm, eerie, whimsical, surreal)
3. Use Comparisons or Metaphors
“A library shaped like a brain”
“A tree growing out of a circuit board”
4. Add Color, Light, Texture
“Glowing neon lights reflected on wet pavement”
“Soft pastel colors and cloudy brush strokes”
5. Use Action Words
“A robot playing violin in the rain”
“A fox leaping across rooftops at dawn”

Possible formula: 
[A subject or scene], [doing something / in a situation], 
[style or medium], [mood/tone], [lighting/colors]

Once your virtual whiteboarding tool is set up, then release one Prompt Theme at a time. Teams can have free reign of interpreting the Prompt Theme however they like. These were the Prompt Themes we used:

- Balance (one of our company values)
- Best day ever
- What an AI dreams of
