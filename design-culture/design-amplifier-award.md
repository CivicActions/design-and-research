# Design Amplifier Award

At the end of 2025, the CivicActions design team launched the Design Amplifier Award, an internal CA-award that recognizes non-design team members who strengthen and elevate human-centered design through leadership, collaboration, innovation, or advocacy, helping increase the quality, visibility, and influence of design across CivicActions and its projects.

## Why We Created This Award

As part of our inaugural company-wide training on human-centered design, we emphasized that applying HCD principles is a shared responsibility across the organization, regardless of role. By formalizing and celebrating this mindset at the team level, we aim to reinforce shared ownership of design quality and continue building a stronger, more human-centered culture in our work. 

## Our Roll-Out Plan

For the first awardees, we directly awarded the award to two team members who had enabled and championed the expanded education of and inclusion of the design team members in the Drupal community. For the next year, we will open nominations once a quarter, and quarterly recognize new Design Amplifiers. The reason we are aiming to award this quarterly in its first year is to build a system and mindset of reward and recognition for human-centered design enablement and quality delivery. At the end of 2026, we will reevaluate the cadence of the award.

Nominations will be solicited via a simple Google form.
