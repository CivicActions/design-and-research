# Asynchronous Design Salon

A way to invite conversation and discussion without adding another meeting!

[Jump to salon starter prompt library](https://github.com/CivicActions/design-and-research/blob/main/design-culture/async-design-salon.md#salon-prompts)

## What tools we used
- Slack as our internal messaging platform
- Kanban tool (Trello, Jira, etc.) to organize ideas and manage what was scheduled and what topics we already covered

## What is an async design salon?
Throughout history, groups of individuals have gathered to share opinions, experiences and ideas in order to expand their knowledge or perspective on a topic. They were respectful, safe spaces where people could engage in healthy debate and share ideas freely. These social gatherings were known as salons.

In order to share ideas, creativity, and discourse with each other without adding an additional meeting, we will be facilitating an asynchronous design salon. Every two weeks, there will be a topic added to the our main design Slack channel intended to spark conversation, questions, and curiosity.

## How does it work?
A pre-scheduled design salon prompt will publish to the Slack channel of your choice. We did a pilot of this in a channel that was only for designers first, and then later moved the salon to a broader, more open design channel that included people from all practice areas.

When you want to add to the conversation, don’t respond to the topic’s post but instead respond with a new message to the channel - that way, people can respond to your thread and there can be different conversations happening in multiple threads, instead of just one thread.

Each salon prompt will include a unique Slackmoji. You will start your own response post with ```[Slackmoji] Salon thread:```

This way you can add your response whenever you want, even if it is hours or days after the scheduled Slack prompt is published. There is no time frame or deadline on when you need to respond - add to the conversation whenever is best for your schedule!

Be sure to engage with other people’s salon posts! The more we engage with each other, the more we will learn about our craft, our passions, and each other!

## The salon facilitator role
The “Salon Topic Facilitator” is responsible for curating and scheduling the salon topic posts, and managing this Trello Board.

### Responsibilities
Time commitment: The expected time commitment is an hour or so every few weeks.

- Review proposed salon topics
- Ask the submitter for clarity when needed.
- Format the topics to match the salon post template, ensuring each post has its own unique slackmoji.
- Board management

### Selecting a topic

- Once a topic is selected by the facilitator, review and edit for clarity, brevity, and engagement (ensure there are open-ended questions) as needed.
- When a topic is scheduled, let the submitter know their topic has been selected and scheduled via a comment in the card.
- Schedule the message to appear in the '''channel.'''
- Once the message is scheduled, move it to the “Scheduled Topics” column and add the scheduled-on date to the title of the card.
- After a salon post is published
- Move the card to the “Published Salon Topics” column.
- Add a link to the Slack post in the description of the card.
- Make calls for topic proposals to the channel as needed.
  
### Become a salon facilitator
If you are interested in becoming a salon topic facilitator, volunteer in the comment section of this card.

### Handing off the salon facilitator role
Before a salon facilitator hands off the role to the next facilitator:

There should be a minimum of 2 scheduled posts queued up to give the new facilitator at least one month to onboard and begin scheduling their next batch of scheduled salon posts.

Before your last scheduled salon post comes out, send a Slack message introducing the next facilitator to the #design channel and do a call for topics so the new facilitator can have some fresh material to work with!

## What makes a good salon topic? 
Topics for the design salon should spark creativity, thoughtful discourse, and allow us to learn more about each other and our respective crafts.

Topics don’t have to be digital design focused - they can cover art and architecture, creative processes, business strategy, coding, in-real-life design patterns and experiences, something you are wondering about, an idea you heard or read that might spark interesting conversation - really anything creative or inspiring that will helps us grow as practitioners, collaborators, and people.

## How to measure success
- Original threads created from salon prompt
- Emoji reactions to original threads or in the thread comments
- Amount of comments in the threads
- Amount of engagement from design vs. other practice areas in your org

### Your Path to Design
Hey, everyone! It’s design salon time. ```[insert post-specific slackmoji]!```

Many of us have lived a few different lives before becoming designers in civic tech. Some of us may have set out on this path intentionally, and others may have ended up here by a series of fortunate events.

What did your path look like? If you knew then what you know now, what are some design experiences in your early career that taught you something that impacted your outlook or processes. What would you time travel back to tell your younger designer self?

### Design Philosophies
Hey, everyone! It’s design salon time. ```[insert post-specific slackmoji]!```

While we have our ```insert company``` design principles that unify us, we all also have our own individual design philosophies and approaches. As succinctly as you can describe it, what is your design philosophy, and how do you bring it into the work that you do?

Remember, don't reply to this thread, but instead reply as a new message in the channel so we can have different threads going on as needed.

### Finding Your Design Voice
Hey, everyone! It’s design salon time. ```[insert post-specific slackmoji]!```

Finding your voice and agency is a pivotal moment for any designer. It can take years of practice to build your confidence and your expertise in order to take ownership and make positive changes in a team, in a project, or at the org level.

As design consultants, it’s important for us to be able to have and to also communicate an opinion on design. I was listening to a talk recently where someone used the analogy that a designer should act as a cartographer: if there is no map, we must be the ones to create the map.

How have you practiced agency as a designer? What is a time where you have had to be the cartographer to draw the map for how a design process should go? What are your tips? What were the challenges? What helps you feel empowered to take ownership as a designer?

### Side Hustles & Your Development
Hey, everyone! It’s design salon time. ```[insert post-specific slackmoji]!```

We all have notable things we have accomplished in our 9-5s, but it seems that whether you are a designer or an engineer, many of us have had at least one (or many) passion projects over the years.

Whether it has impacted your growth as a professional or just as an individual trying to make your way in the world, what are some of your favorite side projects you have worked on? Why did you start it? What did you learn from them? What did you enjoy most, and what was most challenging?

### Most Influential Book, Article, etc.
Hey, everyone! It’s design salon time. ```[insert post-specific slackmoji]!```

Imagine you are being interviewed for Technologist of the Year 2030. They ask you what the most influential book, article, podcast, website, etc. has been for your career as a designer. How would you respond?

### Learning from "Failures"
Hey, everyone! It’s design salon time. ```[insert post-specific slackmoji]!```

We’ve all heard people say failure is not an option, but without failure, can we truly grow? Isn’t trying something for better or for worse at the heart of what we do?

Is there a time where you thought you failed but really became better because of it? Have you had to quell perfectionism in order to set yourself free? How do you embrace experimentation and iteration in the work that you do? Do you have techniques you employ to help reframe your outlook?

### Applying HCD IRL

Hey, everyone! It’s design salon time. ```[insert post-specific slackmoji]!```

We employ design thinking and iteration to the work we do each day on the screen. How have you employed design thinking or human-centered design to something that may be unexpected?

### Deceptive Patterns
Hey, everyone. It’s design salon time! ```[insert post-specific slackmoji]!```

Deceptive UX patterns are out there. They are frustrating. They may make you want to throw your computer at the wall, or your remote at the TV. They can create experiences that are not accessible or inclusive.

If you could use your skills to remove one deceptive pattern from any interface you use, what would it be and how would you do it?

### Design Hot Takes
It’s design salon time! ```[insert post-specific slackmoji]!```

One of the exciting things about design is that there are many different ways to approach solving a single problem. What is an approach or school of thought that is the proverbial “hill that you will die on” when it comes to human-centered design and development processes?

### Comfort Zones 
It’s design salon time! ```[insert post-specific slackmoji]!```

In order to grow, we often must push ourselves outside of our comfort zones. How do you try to push yourself outside of your comfort zone? When is a time you pushed yourself outside of your comfort zone and ended up learning something new, either about yourself or your craft?

### Open-Source Design
It’s design salon time! ```[insert post-specific slackmoji]!```

### Making the Most of What You've Got
It’s design salon time! ```[insert post-specific slackmoji]!```

A lot of the tools we work with are meant to do certain things, but as technologists, we probably often push some of our tools beyond their intended use and use them more creatively than the average user. I think about how a lot of designers used Figma as a deck designer so much that it became a new product - Figma Slides. 

What are some ways you have leveraged a tool in unexpected or creative ways?

### Harnessing Inspiration
It’s design salon time! ```[insert post-specific slackmoji]!```

Staying inspired helps us stay excited about the work we do. What inspires you? Is there a piece of work you always go back to to re-inspire yourself, or do you prefer to seek out new inspiration? How do you harness and document inspiration?

### Storytelling & Design
It’s design salon time! ```[insert post-specific slackmoji]!```

Storytelling is an important part of all the work we do - from pitching a concept, to demoing a new feature. What literary devices do you employ in the work that you do? Provide any examples that have been especially effective with colleagues or stakeholders.
