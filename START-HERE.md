# Start here

This repository documents how the CivicActions design practice operates **in a professional services context**.

It is not a playbook, a portfolio, or a set of fixed processes. It is a shared body of practice meant to be **adapted across clients, scopes, and constraints**.

If this is your first time here, this page will help you understand:
- what this repo is (and isn’t)
- how it’s organized
- where to go based on what you need right now

## First, a quick orientation

### What this repository is
- A public, living record of how we approach design in services
- A place to make implicit judgment explicit
- A resource for designers working without full authority
- A way to share practices, experiments, and learnings openly

### What this repository is not
- A one-size-fits-all process
- A set of mandatory steps
- Documentation for a single in-house product team
- A substitute for professional judgment

Everything here assumes:
- multiple clients
- varied project types
- constrained scope
- client-owned systems and decisions

For more detail, see **SERVICES-CONTEXT.md**.

## How to read and use this material

- Treat guidance as **patterns**, not prescriptions
- Look for context headers (status, audience, project type)
- Scale practices up or down based on scope
- Name tradeoffs explicitly when adapting
- Archive practices when they stop being true

If something feels mis-scoped or unclear, that’s a signal worth addressing.
