# Services context

This repository is written for a **professional services design practice**, not a single in-house product team.

All guidance here assumes design work is delivered across **multiple clients, scopes, and constraints**, often without formal authority or long-term product ownership.

This context matters. How design works in services is materially different from how it works in a single, internally owned product environment.

## What we mean by “professional services”

In a services context, design work is characterized by:

- client-owned products, systems, and decisions
- time- and scope-bound engagements
- varying levels of client maturity and readiness
- multiple stakeholders across organizational boundaries
- designers influencing outcomes without direct authority
- tradeoffs shaped by contracts, governance, and risk tolerance

This repository reflects those realities.

## How to read and use this repository

All practices, guides, and examples should be understood as:

- **adaptable patterns**, not fixed processes
- **context-aware**, not one-size-fits-all
- **portable**, not tied to a single organization or product

Designers are expected to exercise judgment when applying this material, adjusting for:
- project type and phase
- access to stakeholders and users
- delivery constraints
- regulatory and policy environments
- client expectations and decision-making structures

Nothing in this repository should be interpreted as mandatory for all engagements.

## Project types referenced in this repo

Some documents include a **project type** to clarify applicability. Common types include:

- **discovery-only**  
  Short, bounded engagements focused on understanding, framing, and recommendation

- **delivery**  
  Design and build work with defined outcomes or milestones

- **O&M (operations and maintenance)**  
  Ongoing service stewardship, iteration, and support

- **hybrid**  
  Combined or evolving discovery and delivery work

- **varies**  
  Broadly applicable across project types

Project type is descriptive, not prescriptive. It signals context, not permission.

## Authority and influence

Many practices in this repository assume designers are:

- advising rather than deciding
- facilitating rather than owning
- recommending rather than directing

Guidance emphasizes:
- influence through craft, framing, and facilitation
- transparency about tradeoffs
- collaboration across power and organizational boundaries

Where authority is required, it is typically client-held.

---

## Constraints are real

This repository intentionally acknowledges constraints, including:

- limited time and budget
- partial access to users or data
- fixed scope or fixed timelines
- legacy systems and tooling
- regulatory and compliance requirements

Design quality in services is achieved **within constraints**, not by ignoring them.

---

## Examples and templates

Examples and templates in this repository:

- are sanitized and generalized
- remove client-identifying details
- are shared to illustrate approaches, not to be copied verbatim

They should always be adapted to fit client language, goals, and constraints.

---

## Why this context is explicit

Without this context, design guidance often drifts toward:
- in-house product assumptions
- idealized authority
- unrealistic levels of access or control

Making the services context explicit protects:
- credibility
- client trust
- design judgment

It also makes this repository more honest and useful to others working in similar environments.

---

## In summary

This repository exists to support **high-quality, responsible design practice in professional services**.

It favors:
- clarity over certainty
- judgment over prescription
- adaptation over enforcement

Use it as a guide, not a guarantee.
