# Design System Operations Knowledge Base

This knowledge base is intended to provide a list of generalized resources and process documentation for guidance on how people at CivicActions could approach design system operations both internally within CA and on their project work.

People are encouraged to contribute to this knowledge base as new resources are created that would benefit our practice area. We can’t wait to see what you create!
