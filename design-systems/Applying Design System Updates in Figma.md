While the outlined process reflects current best practices, specific steps may vary depending on team workflows, tooling configurations, or evolving design system norms. Always consult with your specific team for guidance on exceptions, edge cases, or changes to this process.

* Open your file in Figma
* Go to the Assets tab (left-hand panel)
* You’ll see an alert next on the Library icon (seen below)

# When to Apply Updates

The table below is just an example of different cadences a designer could use. This can be changed to meet the needs of the work, but the most important thing is that designers are applying updates regularly.

| Situation | Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| When notified | Apply updates that day if possible |
| Weekly file maintenance | Review and apply any pending updates |
| Before final handoff or QA | Ensure your file is using the latest components |

# Definition of Done

* You’ve applied the updates
* Screens have been reviewed and pass QA checks
* You’ve replaced any deprecated components (if applicable)
