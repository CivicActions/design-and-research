# CivicActions Design Practice (Open)

A public home for our Experience Design practice area to share **open processes, tools, templates, and playbooks** for civic tech work.

> This repo is designed for transparency, reuse, and contribution from the community. It includes process docs, facilitation guides, templates, and checklists we use across research, content, product, service, and accessibility design.

## What's inside
- `processes/` – step‑by‑step guides and ways of working
- `templates/` – copy‑ready files for research, workshops, planning, decision logs
- `playbooks/` – end‑to‑end playbooks (e.g., discovery, usability, AI usage)
- `checklists/` – review and quality checks (accessibility, heuristics, crits)
- `workshops/` – facilitation kits with agendas and materials
- `toolkits/` – how‑to guides for tools (Figma, Miro, Maze, Github, etc.)
- `design-ops/` – practice operations (governance, role leveling, rituals)
- `ux-writing/` – content design guidance, standards, voice & tone
- `research/` – research ops, ethics, consent, data handling
- `docs/` – site docs for GitHub Pages (MkDocs), if you enable it
