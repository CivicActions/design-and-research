# Contributing

This repository documents the CivicActions design practice in the open. While it is publicly accessible, **direct contributions are limited to members of the CivicActions design team**.

We share this work openly to support learning, reuse, and transparency, but we steward changes internally to maintain coherence, quality, and accountability.

---

## Who can contribute

### CivicActions design team members
Members of the CivicActions design team may:
- propose changes or additions
- submit pull requests
- review and steward content

### External readers
If you are not part of the design team, you are welcome to:
- open issues with questions or suggestions
- share how you have adapted or learned from this material
- reuse content according to the license

We review external feedback, but we do not accept direct pull requests from outside the team.

## Services context (read first)

This repository is written for a **professional services design practice**, not a single in-house product team.

All content assumes:
- multiple clients and engagements
- varying scopes, timelines, and constraints
- client-owned systems and governance
- designers often working without formal authority

Guidance is intended to be **adapted**, not followed verbatim.

For more detail, see `SERVICES-CONTEXT.md`.

## What we expect from internal contributors

Contributions should:
- reflect current practice or intentionally documented experiments
- be adaptable across different client contexts
- avoid client-specific or sensitive information
- make assumptions and tradeoffs explicit
- prioritize clarity over completeness

If a practice is experimental or retired, it must be clearly labeled.

---

## What not to contribute

Do not add:
- client-identifying information or artifacts
- proprietary or confidential material
- pricing, contracts, or rate information
- HR-only or performance management content
- guidance that cannot reasonably adapt across contexts
- undocumented or speculative AI usage

When unsure, open an issue or discuss internally before publishing.

## Where does this go?

Use the guide below to decide where new content belongs.

- **Values, principles, quality bars** → `foundations/`
- **Collaboration, feedback, influence** → `how-we-work/`
- **Project delivery guidance** → `delivery-guides/`
- **Practice governance and sustainability** → `practice-operations/`
- **Platform- or architecture-specific guidance** → `systems-and-implementation/`
- **AI principles, experiments, governance** → `ai-in-practice/`
- **Reusable artifacts** → `templates/`
- **Sanitized examples of real work** → `examples/`
- **External exemplars** → `design-references/`
- **CivicActions-authored writing** → `thought-leadership/`
- **Curated learning materials** → `learning-resources/`

If placement is unclear, raise it for discussion.

## Required context for substantial documents

For any substantial addition or update, include a short context header at the top of the document:

- Status: draft | active | experiment | archived
- Audience: designers | design leads | cross-functional
- Project type: discovery-only | delivery | O&M | hybrid | varies
- Last reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD
- Maintainer: role or practice area


Not every field must be highly specific, but **project type should be included when it affects applicability**.

---

## Archived and experimental practices

We intentionally share some past or experimental practices for learning.

These must:
- be clearly labeled as `experiment` or `archived`
- explain why the practice was tried
- explain why it was changed or retired
- avoid being framed as current expectations

Archived does not mean unimportant. It means **not authoritative**.

---

## AI-related contributions

Any AI-related content must:
- clearly describe the use case and context
- identify risks and constraints
- define human review expectations
- respect client policies and approvals

AI guidance should be cautious, reviewable, and grounded in real practice.

---

## How to propose changes (internal)

1. Open an issue describing the change or addition
2. Clarify intent, audience, and context
3. Submit a pull request
4. Be open to review and iteration

Structure decisions are design decisions. Discussion is encouraged.

---

## Final note

This repository represents how the CivicActions design practice shows up with clients and partners. Changes affect not just documentation, but expectations and trust.
