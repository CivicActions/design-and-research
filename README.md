# About the CivicActions Design Team

The CivicActions design team is made up of strategists and storytellers, analysts and activators, dedicated to improving experiences that serve the public good. Our work has spanned across federal, state, and local projects in order to help government agencies design with empathy, build with openness, and deliver with impact.

## Our Commitment to Open Design

By working in the open through public repositories, open design artifacts, and transparent documentation, our goals are to make our methods reusable, our learnings visible, and our designs adaptable for others working to improve design delivery in the public realm and beyond. We hope to provide insight and inspiration to anyone looking for practical design advice and examples. Our goal is that you will find something in this repo that you can build upon that will help you amplify your impact. 

## What We Design
- We design systems: the underlying architecture that powers services.
- We design processes: how people and information move through a service.
- We design structures: content models, data models, IA, navigation, and decision paths.
- We design governance: how content, patterns, and services are maintained.
- We design content: what people read, hear, understand and interact with.
- We design interactions: how people engage with tools, forms, and flows
- We design data experiences: how information is collected, displayed, and understood.
- We design connections: between people, systems, policies, and touchpoints.
- We design trust: by making services clear, usable, and accessible.
- We design outcomes: not just artifacts, but real-world, measurable impact for users and agencies.
